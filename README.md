A Sacred Pilgrimage: Erumeli to Pamba to Sannidhanam
My Sabarimala journey this year followed the traditional and most spiritually rich route—Erumeli → Pamba → Sannidhanam. This path is not only physically demanding but also deeply symbolic, representing purification, devotion, and the transformation of the mind.
Starting at Erumeli – The Beginning of Devotion
The journey began at Erumeli, a place that holds immense significance in Sabarimala tradition. Devotees perform the ritual known as Petta Thullal, a joyful dance symbolising the victory of good over evil. The streets were filled with music, colours, and pure spiritual excitement.
Visiting the Vavar Mosque, offering prayers, and receiving blessings reminded me of the beautiful message of Sabarimala—unity and equality beyond religion.
With the Irumudi Kettu tied and devotion filling every heartbeat, the long trek toward Pamba began.
The Trek Through Forests to Pamba
The journey from Erumeli to Pamba is a true test of endurance. We walked through forests, hills, and narrow paths, chanting “Swamiye Saranam Ayyappa” with every step.
Reaching Pamba felt like arriving at a sacred threshold. The Pamba River is considered holy, and a dip in its chilly, refreshing water washed away the tiredness of the long trek.
It is believed that this purification prepares the devotee spiritually before climbing to the divine hill.
After resting and offering prayers at Ganapathi Temple, the final ascent to Sannidhanam began.
Climbing to Sannidhanam – The Final Divine Path
The climb from Pamba to Sannidhanam is steep but incredibly fulfilling. Pilgrims support each other, strangers become companions, and every chant echoes with devotion.
As the shrine came into view, my heart filled with emotion. The moment I stood before the Pathinettam Padi (18 Sacred Steps), I felt a deep sense of gratitude. Climbing these steps with the Irumudi is a sacred privilege.
Stepping into the sanctum and seeing Lord Ayyappa was a moment beyond words—pure, peaceful, and powerful. Every difficulty of the journey felt worth it.
A Journey That Transforms the Soul
The pilgrimage through Erumeli → Pamba → Sannidhanam isn’t just a physical path.
It is a journey of the heart.
It teaches patience, discipline, equality, and faith.
It breaks ego and strengthens devotion.
It makes you stronger, calmer, and more grateful.
This spiritual journey will stay with me forever.
